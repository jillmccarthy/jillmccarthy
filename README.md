### Hi there! I'm Jill ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data and coding enthusiast interested in using data to help solve clinical questions and bring meaning healthcare solutions to the world.

I recently completed my PhD in Neuroscience at McGill Universiy in Montreal, where I used statistical models to study MRI measures as early stage biomarkers in       frontotemporal dementia.
